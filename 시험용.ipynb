To her disappointment, she had  failed  to  beat  her  personal  best  time,  again.  Jamie  had pushed  herself  for  months  to  finally  break  her  record,  but  it was  all  for  nothing.  Recognizing  how  she  felt  about  her failure, Ken, her  teammate, approached  her and said, “Jamie, even  though  you  didn’t  set  a  personal  best  time  today,  your performances have improved dramatically. Your running skills have progressed so much! You’ll definitely break your personal best  time  in  the  next  race!”  After  hearing  his  comments,  she felt  confident  about  herself.

Each choice involves uncertainty about which path will get you to your destination. Trusting our intuition to make the choice  often  ends  up  with  us  making  a  suboptimal  choice. Turning the uncertainty into numbers has proved a potent way of analyzing the paths and finding the shortcut to your destination. The mathematical theory of probability hasn’t eliminated risk, but it allows us to manage that risk more effectively. The strategy is to analyze all the possible scenarios that the future holds and then to see what proportion of them lead to success or failure. This gives you a much better map of the future on which to base your decisions about which path to choose.* junction: 분기점 ** suboptimal: 차선의① 성공적인 삶을 위해 미래에 대한 구체적인 계획을 세워야 한다.② 중요한 결정을 내릴 때에는 자신의 직관에 따라 판단해야 한다.③ 더 나은 선택을 위해 성공 가능성을 확률적으로 분석해야 한다.④ 빠른 목표 달성을 위해 지름길로 가고자 할 때 신중해야 한다. ⑤ 인생의 여정에서 선택에 따른 결과를 스스로 책임져야 한다.28이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\x0c홀수형321. 밑줄 친 make oneself public to oneself 가 다음 글에서 의미23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]Coming of age in the 18th and 19th centuries, the personal diary  became  a  centerpiece  in  the  construction  of  a  modern subjectivity, at the heart of which is the application of reason and  critique  to  the  understanding  of  world  and  self,  which allowed the creation of a new kind of knowledge. Diaries were central  media  through  which  enlightened  and  free  subjects could be constructed. They provided a space where one could write  daily  about  her  whereabouts,  feelings,  and  thoughts. Over  time  and  with  rereading,  disparate  entries,  events,  and happenstances  could  be  rendered  into  insights  and  narratives about the self, and allowed for the formation of subjectivity. It is in that context that the idea of “the self [as] both made and explored  with  words”  emerges.  Diaries  were  personal  and private;  one  would  write  for  oneself,  or,  in  Habermas’s formulation,  one  would  make  oneself  public  to  oneself.  By making the self public in a private sphere, the self also became an object for self-inspection and self-critique.* disparate: 이질적인 ** render: 만들다① use writing as a means of reflecting on oneself② build one’s identity by reading others’ diaries③ exchange feedback in the process of writing④ create an alternate ego to present to others⑤ develop topics for writing about selfhoodAn  important  advantage  of  disclosure,  as  opposed  to  more aggressive forms of regulation, is its flexibility and respect for the  operation  of  free  markets.  Regulatory  mandates  are  blunt swords;  they  tend  to  neglect  diversity  and  may  have  serious unintended  adverse  effects.  For  example,  energy  efficiency requirements for appliances may produce goods that work less well  or  that  have  characteristics  that  consumers  do  not  want. Information  provision,  by  contrast,  respects  freedom  of choice.  If  automobile  manufacturers  are  required  to  measure and  publicize  the  safety  characteristics  of  cars,  potential  car purchasers  can  trade  safety  concerns  against  other  attributes, such as price and styling. If restaurant customers are informed of  the  calories  in  their  meals,  those  who  want  to  lose  weight can  make  use  of  the  information,  leaving  those  who  are unconcerned  about  calories  unaffected.  Disclosure  does  not interfere  with,  and  should  even  promote,  the  autonomy  (and quality) of individual decision-making.* mandate: 명령 ** adverse: 거스르는 *** autonomy: 자율성① steps to make public information accessible to customers ② benefits of publicizing information to ensure free choices③ strategies for companies to increase profits in a free market④ necessities of identifying and analyzing current industry trends⑤ effects of diversified markets on reasonable customer choices22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?Urban  delivery  vehicles  can  be  adapted  to  better  suit  the density  of  urban  distribution,  which  often  involves  smaller vehicles such as vans, including bicycles. The latter have the potential to become a preferred ‘last-mile’ vehicle, particularly in  high-density  and  congested  areas.  In  locations  where bicycle use is high, such as the Netherlands, delivery bicycles are also  used  to carry  personal cargo  (e.g.  groceries).  Due  to their  low  acquisition  and  maintenance  costs,  cargo  bicycles convey much potential in developed and developing countries alike, such as the becak (a three-wheeled bicycle) in Indonesia. Services  using  electrically  assisted  delivery  tricycles  have been  successfully  implemented  in  France  and  are  gradually being  adopted  across  Europe  for  services  as  varied  as  parcel and  catering  deliveries.  Using  bicycles  as  cargo  vehicles  is particularly  encouraged  when  combined  with  policies  that restrict motor vehicle access to specific areas of a city, such as downtown  or  commercial  districts,  or  with  the  extension  of dedicated bike lanes.Different parts of the brain’s visual system get information on  a  need-to-know  basis.  Cells  that  help  your  hand  muscles reach  out  to  an  object  need  to  know  the  size  and  location  of the object, but they don’t need to know about color. They need to know a little about shape, but not in great detail. Cells that help  you  recognize  people’s  faces  need  to  be  extremely sensitive to details of shape, but they can pay less attention to location. It is natural to assume that anyone who sees an object sees  everything  about  it ― the  shape,  color,  location,  and movement.  However,  one  part  of  your  brain  sees  its  shape, another  sees  color,  another  detects  location,  and  another perceives  movement.  Consequently,  after  localized  brain damage,  it  is  possible  to  see  certain  aspects  of  an  object  and not others. Centuries ago, people found it difficult to imagine how someone could see an object without seeing what color it is.  Even  today,  you  might  find  it  surprising  to  learn  about people who see an object without seeing where it is, or see it without seeing whether it is moving.① 도시에서 자전거는 효율적인 배송 수단으로 사용될 수 있다.② 자전거는 출퇴근 시간을 줄이기 위한 대안으로 선호되고 있다.③ 자전거는 배송 수단으로의 경제적 장단점을 모두 가질 수 있다.④ 수요자의 요구에 부합하는 다양한 용도의 자전거가 개발되고 있다.⑤ 세계 각국에서는 전기 자전거 사용을 장려하는 정책을 추진하고 있다.① Visual Systems Never Betray Our Trust!② Secret Missions of Color-Sensitive Brain Cells③ Blind Spots: What Is Still Unknown About the Brain④ Why Brain Cells Exemplify Nature’s Recovery Process⑤ Separate and Independent: Brain Cells’ Visual Perceptions38이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\x0c4홀수형25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는  것은?27. 다음 Renovation Notice의 내용과 일치하지 않는  것은?Renovation NoticeAt the Natural Jade Resort, we are continually improving our facilities to better serve our guests.

After World War II, he studied law at the University of Freiburg until 1949. Early in his career, he worked for the State of Lower Saxony, where he was in charge of educational reform. In 1960—1961, Luhmann  had  the  chance  to  study  sociology  at  Harvard University,  where  he  was  influenced  by  Talcott  Parsons,  one of  the  most  famous  social  system  theorists.  Later,  Luhmann developed his own social system theory. In 1968, he became a professor  of  sociology  at  the  University  of  Bielefeld.  He researched  a  variety  of  subjects,  including  mass  media  and law. Although his books are known to be difficult to translate, they have in fact been widely translated into other languages.① 제2차 세계 대전 이후에 법을 공부했다.② State of Lower Saxony에서 교육 개혁을 담당했다.③ Harvard University에 있을 때 Talcott Parsons의 영향을 받았다.④ 다양한 주제에 관해 연구했다.⑤ 그의 책은 번역하기가 쉽다고 알려져 있다.\\U000f0802 Participation is only for high school students in Valestown.\\U000f0802 Participants should use the theme of “Recycling for the Future.”Submission Format\\U000f0802 File type: PDF only\\U000f0802 Maximum file size: 40MBJudging Criteria\\U000f0802 Use of theme\\U000f0802 Creativity\\U000f0802 Artistic skillDetails\\U000f0802 Submissions are limited to one poster per person.\\U000f0802 Submissions should be uploaded to the website by 6 p.m., December 19.\\U000f0802 Winners will be announced on the website on December 28.For more information, please visit www.vtco.org.① Valestown의 모든 학생들이 참여할 수 있다.② 참가자는 포스터의 주제 선정에 제약을 받지 않는다.③ 출품할 파일 양식은 자유롭게 선택 가능하다.④ 심사 기준에 창의성이 포함된다.⑤ 1인당 출품할 수 있는 포스터의 수에는 제한이 없다.48이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\x0c홀수형529. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,  어법상 틀린  것은?[31～34] 다음 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오.Trends constantly suggest new opportunities for individuals to  restage  themselves,  representing  occasions  for  change.  To understand  how  trends  can  ultimately  give  individuals  power and freedom, one must first discuss fashion’s importance as a basis  for  change.  The  most  common  explanation  offered  by my  informants  as to why fashion  is so  appealing  is ① that it constitutes a kind of theatrical costumery. Clothes are part of how people present ② them to the world, and fashion locates them  in  the  present,  relative  to  what  is  happening  in  society and to fashion’s own history. As a form of expression, fashion contains a host of ambiguities, enabling individuals to recreate the  meanings ③ associated  with  specific  pieces  of  clothing. Fashion  is  among  the  simplest  and  cheapest  methods  of self-expression:  clothes  can  be ④ inexpensively  purchased while making it easy to convey notions of wealth, intellectual stature,  relaxation  or  environmental  consciousness,  even  if none  of  these  is  true.  Fashion  can  also  strengthen  agency  in various ways, ⑤ opening up space for action.* stature: 능력31. There is something deeply paradoxical about the professional status of sports journalism, especially in the medium of print. In  discharging  their  usual  responsibilities  of  description  and commentary,  reporters’  accounts  of  sports  events  are  eagerly consulted  by  sports  fans,  while  in  their  broader  journalistic role of covering sport in its many forms, sports journalists are among  the  most  visible  of  all  contemporary  writers.  The ruminations  of  the  elite  class  of  ‘celebrity’  sports  journalists are much sought after by the major newspapers, their lucrative contracts being the envy of colleagues in other ‘disciplines’ of journalism.  Yet  sports  journalists  do  not  have  a  standing  in their profession that corresponds to the size of their readerships or of their pay packets, with the old saying (now reaching the status of cliché) that sport is the ‘toy department of the news media’ still readily to hand as a dismissal of the worth of what sports journalists do. This reluctance to take sports journalism seriously  produces  the  paradoxical  outcome  that  sports newspaper writers are much read but little.* discharge: 이행하다 ** rumination: 생각*** lucrative: 돈을 많이 버는② admired④ challenged① paid③ censored⑤ discussed30. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,  문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은  것은? [3점]Everywhere we turn we hear about almighty “cyberspace”! The hype promises that we will leave our boring lives, put on goggles and body suits, and enter some metallic, three-dimensional, multimedia otherworld. When the Industrial Revolution arrived with its great innovation, the motor, we didn’t leave our world to  go  to  some ① remote  motorspace!  On  the  contrary,  we brought the motors into our lives, as automobiles, refrigerators, drill  presses,  and  pencil  sharpeners.  This ② absorption  has been so complete that we refer to all these tools with names that declare  their  usage,  not  their  “motorness.”  These  innovations led to a major socioeconomic movement precisely because they entered and ③ affected profoundly our everyday lives. People have  not  changed  fundamentally  in  thousands  of  years. Technology changes constantly. It’s the one that must ④ adapt to us. That’s exactly what will happen with information technology and its devices under human-centric computing. The longer we continue to believe that computers will take us to a magical new world, the longer we will ⑤ maintain their natural fusion with our lives, the hallmark of every major movement that aspires to be called a socioeconomic revolution.* hype: 과대광고 ** hallmark: 특징32. People have always wanted to be around other people and to  learn from  them.  Cities  have long  been dynamos of social possibility, foundries of art, music, and fashion. Slang, or, if you prefer,  “lexical  innovation,”  has  always  started  in  cities ― an outgrowth of all those different people so frequently exposed to one another. It spreads outward, in a manner not unlike trans-missible disease, which itself typically “takes off” in cities. If, as the noted linguist Leonard Bloomfield argued, the way a person talks is a “composite result of what he has heard before,” then language innovation would happen where the most people heard and talked to the most other people. Cities drive taste change , because they who not surprisingly are often the creative people cities seem to  attract.  Media,  ever  more  global,  ever  more  far-reaching, spread language faster to more people.* foundry: 주물 공장 ** lexical: 어휘의① provide rich source materials for artists② offer the greatest exposure to other people③ cause cultural conflicts among users of slang④ present ideal research environments to linguists⑤ reduce the social mobility of ambitious outsiders58이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\x0c633. The  entrance  to  a  honeybee  colony,  often  referred  to  as the  dancefloor,  is  a  market  place  for  information  about  the state  of  the  colony  and  the  environment  outside  the  hive. Studying  interactions  on  the  dancefloor  provides  us  with  a number  of individuals illustrative  examples  of  how changing their own behavior in response to local information . Forexample,  upon  returning  to  their  hive  honeybees  that  have collected water search out a receiver bee to unload their water to within the hive. If this search time is short then the returning bee is more likely to perform a waggle dance to recruit others to the water source. Conversely, if this search time is long then the  bee  is  more  likely  to  give  up  collecting  water.  Since receiver bees will only accept water if they require it, either for themselves or to pass on to other bees and brood, this unloading time is correlated with the colony’s overall need of water. Thus the individual water forager’s response to unloading time (up or down)  regulates  water  collection  in  response  to  the  colony’s need.

We  understand  that  the  segregation  of  our  consciousness into  present,  past,  and  future  is  both  a  fiction  and  an  oddly self-referential  framework;  your  present  was  part  of  your mother’s  future, and your children’s  past will be in  part your present.  Nothing  is  generally  wrong  with  structuring  our consciousness of time in this conventional manner, and it often works  well  enough.  In  the  case  of  climate  change,  however, the  sharp  division  of  time  into  past,  present,  and  future  has been  desperately  misleading  and  has,  most  importantly, hidden  from  view  the  extent  of  the  responsibility  of  those  of us  alive  now.  The  narrowing  of  our  consciousness  of  time smooths  the  way  to  divorcing  ourselves  from  responsibility for developments in the past and the future with which our lives are in fact deeply intertwined. In the climate case, it is not that .  It  is that the realities are obscured from view by the partitioning of time,  and  so  questions  of  responsibility  toward  the  past  and future do not arise naturally.

Learning to  control  your  voice  and  use  it  for  different  purposes  is, therefore, one of the most important skills to develop as an early career teacher. ① The more confidently you give instructions, the higher the chance of a positive class response. ② There are times when being able to project your voice loudly will be very useful when working in school, and knowing that you can cut through a noisy classroom, dinner hall or playground is a great skill  to  have. ③ In  order  to  address  serious  noise  issues  in school,  students,  parents  and  teachers  should  search  for  a solution together. ④ However, I would always advise that you use your loudest voice incredibly sparingly and avoid shouting as  much  as  possible. ⑤ A  quiet,  authoritative  and  measured tone has so much more impact than slightly panicked shouting.[36～37] 주어진  글  다음에  이어질  글의  순서로  가장  적절한 것을 고르시오.36.A  fascinating  species  of  water  flea  exhibits  a  kind  of flexibility that evolutionary biologists call adaptive plasticity.(A) That’s  a  clever  trick,  because  producing  spines  and  a helmet  is  costly,  in  terms  of  energy,  and  conserving energy is essential for an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. The water flea only expends the energy needed to produce spines and a helmet when it needs to.(B) If the baby water flea is developing into an adult in water that  includes  the  chemical  signatures  of  creatures  that prey  on  water  fleas,  it  develops  a  helmet  and  spines  to defend  itself  against  predators.  If  the  water  around  it doesn’t  include  the  chemical  signatures  of  predators,  the water flea doesn’t develop these protective devices.(C) So  it  may  well  be  that  this  plasticity  is  an  adaptation:  a trait that came to exist in a species because it contributed to  reproductive  fitness.  There  are  many  cases,  across many species, of adaptive plasticity. Plasticity is conducive to fitness if there is sufficient variation in the environment.* spine: 가시 돌기 ** conducive: 도움되는② (B) － (A) － (C)④ (C) － (A) － (B)① (A) － (C) － (B)③ (B) － (C) － (A)⑤ (C) － (B) － (A)68이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\x0c홀수형37.39.  7The most commonly known form of results-based pricing is a practice called contingency pricing, used by lawyers.It  may  be  easier  to  reach  an  agreement  when  settlement terms don’t have to be implemented until months in the future.(A) Therefore,  only  an  outcome  in  the  client’s  favor  is compensated. From the client’s point of view, the pricing makes sense in part because most clients in these cases are unfamiliar  with  and  possibly  intimidated  by  law  firms. Their biggest fears are high fees for a case that may take years to settle.(B) By using contingency pricing, clients are ensured that they pay  no  fees  until  they  receive  a  settlement.  In  these  and other instances of contingency pricing, the economic value of the service is hard to determine before the service, and providers  develop  a  price  that  allows  them  to  share  the risks and rewards of delivering value to the buyer.(C) Contingency pricing is the major way that personal injury and  certain  consumer  cases  are  billed.  In  this  approach, lawyers  do  not  receive  fees  or  payment  until  the  case  is settled, when they are paid a percentage of the money that the client receives. [3점]Negotiators should try to find ways to slice a large issue into smaller  pieces,  known  as  using  salami  tactics. ( ① ) Issues that can be expressed in quantitative, measurable units are easy to  slice. ( ② ) For  example,  compensation  demands  can  be divided  into  cents-per-hour  increments  or  lease  rates  can  be quoted  as  dollars  per  square  foot. ( ③ ) When  working  to fractionate issues of principle or precedent, parties may use the time horizon (when the principle goes into effect or how long it will  last)  as  a  way  to  fractionate  the  issue. ( ④ ) Another approach is to vary the number of ways that the principle may be  applied. ( ⑤ ) For  example,  a  company  may  devise  a family  emergency  leave  plan  that  allows  employees  the opportunity to be away from the company for a period of no longer  than  three  hours,  and  no  more  than  once  a  month,  for illness in the employee’s immediate family.

There’s  a  reason  for  that:  traditionally,  park  designers attempted to create such a feeling by planting tall trees at park  boundaries,  building  stone  walls,  and  constructing other means of partition. Parks take the shape demanded by the cultural concerns of their time. Once parks are in place, they are no inert stage ―their purposes and meanings are made and remade by planners and  by  park users. Moments  of  park  creation  are  particularly telling,  however,  for  they  reveal  and  actualize  ideas  about nature and its relationship to urban society. ( ① ) Indeed, what distinguishes a park from the broader category of public space is the representation of nature that parks are meant to embody.( ② ) Public spaces include parks, concrete plazas, sidewalks, even indoor atriums. ( ③ ) Parks typically have trees, grass, and other plants as their central features. ( ④ ) When entering a  city  park,  people  often  imagine  a  sharp  separation  from streets, cars, and buildings. ( ⑤ ) What’s behind  this idea is not  only  landscape  architects’  desire  to  design  aesthetically suggestive park spaces, but a much longer history of Western thought  that  envisions  cities  and  nature  as  antithetical  spaces and oppositional forces.* aesthetically: 미적으로 ** antithetical: 대조적인78“Craftsmanship” may suggest a way of life that declined with the arrival of industrial society ― but this is misleading. Craftsmanship  names  an  enduring,  basic  human  impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake. Craftsmanship cuts a far wider swath than skilled manual labor; it serves the  computer  programmer,  the  doctor,  and  the  artist; parenting  improves when it is practiced  as  a skilled  craft, as  does  citizenship.  In  all  these  domains,  craftsmanship focuses on objective standards, on the thing in itself. Social and economic conditions, however, often stand in the way of the craftsman’s discipline and commitment: schools may fail to provide the tools to do good work, and workplaces may not truly value the aspiration for quality. And though craftsmanship  can  reward  an  individual  with  a  sense  of pride  in  work,  this  reward  is  not  simple.  The  craftsman often  faces  conflicting  objective  standards  of  excellence; the  desire  to  do  something  well  for  its  own  sake  can  be weakened  by  competitive  pressure,  by  frustration,  or  by obsession.* swath: 구획\\U000f003bCraftsmanship, a human desire that hasover time  in  diverse  contexts,  often  encounters  factors  that (A)(B)(A)its full development.(B)(A)(B)① persisted … limit③ evolved … accelerate⑤ diminished … restrict② persisted … cultivate④ diminished … shape이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\x0c8홀수형[41～42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.(B)There  is  evidence  that  even  very  simple  algorithms  can outperform expert judgement on simple prediction problems. For example, algorithms have proved more (a) accurate than humans  in  predicting  whether  a  prisoner  released  on  parole will go on to commit another crime, or in predicting whether a potential candidate will perform well in a job in future. In over  100  studies  across  many  different  domains,  half  of  all cases  show  simple  formulas  make (b) better  significant predictions than human experts, and the remainder (except a very small handful), show a tie between the two. When there are a lot of different factors involved and a situation is very uncertain,  simple  formulas  can  win  out  by  focusing  on  the most  important  factors  and  being  consistent,  while  human judgement is too easily influenced by particularly salient and perhaps (c) irrelevant  considerations.  A  similar is supported  by  further  evidence  that  ‘checklists’  can  improve the  quality  of  expert  decisions  in  a  range  of  domains  by ensuring that important steps or considerations aren’t missed when  people  are  feeling (d) relaxed.  For  example,  treating patients  in  intensive  care  can  require  hundreds  of  small actions per day, and one small error could cost a life. Using checklists  to  ensure  that  no  crucial  steps  are  missed  has proved  to  be  remarkably (e) effective  in  a  range  of  medical contexts,  from  preventing to  reducing pneumonia.infections idea live * parole: 가석방 ** salient: 두드러진 *** pneumonia: 폐렴41. 윗글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?① The Power of Simple Formulas in Decision Making② Always Prioritise: Tips for Managing Big Data③ Algorithms’ Mistakes: The Myth of Simplicity④ Be Prepared!

Each choice involves uncertainty about which path will get you to your destination. Trusting our intuition to make the choice  often  ends  up  with  us  making  a  suboptimal  choice. Turning the uncertainty into numbers has proved a potent way of analyzing the paths and finding the shortcut to your destination. The mathematical theory of probability hasn’t eliminated risk, but it allows us to manage that risk more effectively. The strategy is to analyze all the possible scenarios that the future holds and then to see what proportion of them lead to success or failure. This gives you a much better map of the future on which to base your decisions about which path to choose.* junction: 분기점 ** suboptimal: 차선의① 더 나은 선택을 위해 성공 가능성을 확률적으로 분석해야 한다.② 중요한 결정을 내릴 때에는 자신의 직관에 따라 판단해야 한다.③ 성공적인 삶을 위해 미래에 대한 구체적인 계획을 세워야 한다.④ 빠른 목표 달성을 위해 지름길로 가고자 할 때 신중해야 한다. ⑤ 인생의 여정에서 선택에 따른 결과를 스스로 책임져야 한다.28이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\x0c짝수형321. 밑줄 친 make oneself public to oneself 가 다음 글에서 의미23. 다음 글의 주제로 가장 적절한 것은?

[3점]Coming of age in the 18th and 19th centuries, the personal diary  became  a  centerpiece  in  the  construction  of  a  modern subjectivity, at the heart of which is the application of reason and  critique  to  the  understanding  of  world  and  self,  which allowed the creation of a new kind of knowledge. Diaries were central  media  through  which  enlightened  and  free  subjects could be constructed. They provided a space where one could write  daily  about  her  whereabouts,  feelings,  and  thoughts. Over  time  and  with  rereading,  disparate  entries,  events,  and happenstances  could  be  rendered  into  insights  and  narratives about the self, and allowed for the formation of subjectivity. It is in that context that the idea of “the self [as] both made and explored  with  words”  emerges.  Diaries  were  personal  and private;  one  would  write  for  oneself,  or,  in  Habermas’s formulation,  one  would  make  oneself  public  to  oneself.  By making the self public in a private sphere, the self also became an object for self-inspection and self-critique.* disparate: 이질적인 ** render: 만들다① use writing as a means of reflecting on oneself② build one’s identity by reading others’ diaries③ exchange feedback in the process of writing④ create an alternate ego to present to others⑤ develop topics for writing about selfhoodAn  important  advantage  of  disclosure,  as  opposed  to  more aggressive forms of regulation, is its flexibility and respect for the  operation  of  free  markets.  Regulatory  mandates  are  blunt swords;  they  tend  to  neglect  diversity  and  may  have  serious unintended  adverse  effects.  For  example,  energy  efficiency requirements for appliances may produce goods that work less well  or  that  have  characteristics  that  consumers  do  not  want. Information  provision,  by  contrast,  respects  freedom  of choice.  If  automobile  manufacturers  are  required  to  measure and  publicize  the  safety  characteristics  of  cars,  potential  car purchasers  can  trade  safety  concerns  against  other  attributes, such as price and styling. If restaurant customers are informed of  the  calories  in  their  meals,  those  who  want  to  lose  weight can  make  use  of  the  information,  leaving  those  who  are unconcerned  about  calories  unaffected.  Disclosure  does  not interfere  with,  and  should  even  promote,  the  autonomy  (and quality) of individual decision-making.* mandate: 명령 ** adverse: 거스르는 *** autonomy: 자율성① effects of diversified markets on reasonable customer choices② necessities of identifying and analyzing current industry trends③ strategies for companies to increase profits in a free market④ benefits of publicizing information to ensure free choices⑤ steps to make public information accessible to customers 22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?Urban  delivery  vehicles  can  be  adapted  to  better  suit  the density  of  urban  distribution,  which  often  involves  smaller vehicles such as vans, including bicycles. The latter have the potential to become a preferred ‘last-mile’ vehicle, particularly in  high-density  and  congested  areas.  In  locations  where bicycle use is high, such as the Netherlands, delivery bicycles are also  used  to carry  personal cargo  (e.g.  groceries).  Due  to their  low  acquisition  and  maintenance  costs,  cargo  bicycles convey much potential in developed and developing countries alike, such as the becak (a three-wheeled bicycle) in Indonesia. Services  using  electrically  assisted  delivery  tricycles  have been  successfully  implemented  in  France  and  are  gradually being  adopted  across  Europe  for  services  as  varied  as  parcel and  catering  deliveries.  Using  bicycles  as  cargo  vehicles  is particularly  encouraged  when  combined  with  policies  that restrict motor vehicle access to specific areas of a city, such as downtown  or  commercial  districts,  or  with  the  extension  of dedicated bike lanes.Different parts of the brain’s visual system get information on  a  need-to-know  basis.  Cells  that  help  your  hand  muscles reach  out  to  an  object  need  to  know  the  size  and  location  of the object, but they don’t need to know about color. They need to know a little about shape, but not in great detail. Cells that help  you  recognize  people’s  faces  need  to  be  extremely sensitive to details of shape, but they can pay less attention to location. It is natural to assume that anyone who sees an object sees  everything  about  it ― the  shape,  color,  location,  and movement.  However,  one  part  of  your  brain  sees  its  shape, another  sees  color,  another  detects  location,  and  another perceives  movement.  Consequently,  after  localized  brain damage,  it  is  possible  to  see  certain  aspects  of  an  object  and not others. Centuries ago, people found it difficult to imagine how someone could see an object without seeing what color it is.  Even  today,  you  might  find  it  surprising  to  learn  about people who see an object without seeing where it is, or see it without seeing whether it is moving.① 세계 각국에서는 전기 자전거 사용을 장려하는 정책을 추진하고 있다.② 수요자의 요구에 부합하는 다양한 용도의 자전거가 개발되고 있다.③ 자전거는 배송 수단으로의 경제적 장단점을 모두 가질 수 있다.④ 자전거는 출퇴근 시간을 줄이기 위한 대안으로 선호되고 있다.⑤ 도시에서 자전거는 효율적인 배송 수단으로 사용될 수 있다.① Separate and Independent: Brain Cells’ Visual Perceptions② Why Brain Cells Exemplify Nature’s Recovery Process③ Blind Spots: What Is Still Unknown About the Brain④ Secret Missions of Color-Sensitive Brain Cells⑤ Visual Systems Never Betray Our Trust!38이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\x0c4짝수형25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는  것은?27. 다음 Renovation Notice의 내용과 일치하지 않는  것은?Renovation NoticeAt the Natural Jade Resort, we are continually improving our facilities to better serve our guests.

After World War II, he studied law at the University of Freiburg until 1949. Early in his career, he worked for the State of Lower Saxony, where he was in charge of educational reform. In 1960—1961, Luhmann  had  the  chance  to  study  sociology  at  Harvard University,  where  he  was  influenced  by  Talcott  Parsons,  one of  the  most  famous  social  system  theorists.  Later,  Luhmann developed his own social system theory. In 1968, he became a professor  of  sociology  at  the  University  of  Bielefeld.  He researched  a  variety  of  subjects,  including  mass  media  and law. Although his books are known to be difficult to translate, they have in fact been widely translated into other languages.① 제2차 세계 대전 이후에 법을 공부했다.② State of Lower Saxony에서 교육 개혁을 담당했다.③ Harvard University에 있을 때 Talcott Parsons의 영향을 받았다.④ 다양한 주제에 관해 연구했다.⑤ 그의 책은 번역하기가 쉽다고 알려져 있다.\\U000f0802 Participation is only for high school students in Valestown.\\U000f0802 Participants should use the theme of “Recycling for the Future.”Submission Format\\U000f0802 File type: PDF only\\U000f0802 Maximum file size: 40MBJudging Criteria\\U000f0802 Use of theme\\U000f0802 Creativity\\U000f0802 Artistic skillDetails\\U000f0802 Submissions are limited to one poster per person.\\U000f0802 Submissions should be uploaded to the website by 6 p.m., December 19.\\U000f0802 Winners will be announced on the website on December 28.For more information, please visit www.vtco.org.① Valestown의 모든 학생들이 참여할 수 있다.② 참가자는 포스터의 주제 선정에 제약을 받지 않는다.③ 출품할 파일 양식은 자유롭게 선택 가능하다.④ 심사 기준에 창의성이 포함된다.⑤ 1인당 출품할 수 있는 포스터의 수에는 제한이 없다.48이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\x0c짝수형529. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,  어법상 틀린  것은?[31～34] 다음 빈칸에 들어갈 말로 가장 적절한 것을 고르시오.Trends constantly suggest new opportunities for individuals to  restage  themselves,  representing  occasions  for  change.  To understand  how  trends  can  ultimately  give  individuals  power and freedom, one must first discuss fashion’s importance as a basis  for  change.  The  most  common  explanation  offered  by my  informants  as to why fashion  is so  appealing  is ① that it constitutes a kind of theatrical costumery. Clothes are part of how people present ② them to the world, and fashion locates them  in  the  present,  relative  to  what  is  happening  in  society and to fashion’s own history. As a form of expression, fashion contains a host of ambiguities, enabling individuals to recreate the  meanings ③ associated  with  specific  pieces  of  clothing. Fashion  is  among  the  simplest  and  cheapest  methods  of self-expression:  clothes  can  be ④ inexpensively  purchased while making it easy to convey notions of wealth, intellectual stature,  relaxation  or  environmental  consciousness,  even  if none  of  these  is  true.  Fashion  can  also  strengthen  agency  in various ways, ⑤ opening up space for action.31. There is something deeply paradoxical about the professional status of sports journalism, especially in the medium of print. In  discharging  their  usual  responsibilities  of  description  and commentary,  reporters’  accounts  of  sports  events  are  eagerly consulted  by  sports  fans,  while  in  their  broader  journalistic role of covering sport in its many forms, sports journalists are among  the  most  visible  of  all  contemporary  writers.  The ruminations  of  the  elite  class  of  ‘celebrity’  sports  journalists are much sought after by the major newspapers, their lucrative contracts being the envy of colleagues in other ‘disciplines’ of journalism.  Yet  sports  journalists  do  not  have  a  standing  in their profession that corresponds to the size of their readerships or of their pay packets, with the old saying (now reaching the status of cliché) that sport is the ‘toy department of the news media’ still readily to hand as a dismissal of the worth of what sports journalists do. This reluctance to take sports journalism seriously  produces  the  paradoxical  outcome  that  sports newspaper writers are much read but little.* stature: 능력* discharge: 이행하다 ** rumination: 생각*** lucrative: 돈을 많이 버는① admired③ discussed⑤ challenged② paid④ censored30. 다음 글의 밑줄 친 부분 중,  문맥상 낱말의 쓰임이 적절하지 않은  것은? [3점]Everywhere we turn we hear about almighty “cyberspace”! The hype promises that we will leave our boring lives, put on goggles and body suits, and enter some metallic, three-dimensional, multimedia otherworld. When the Industrial Revolution arrived with its great innovation, the motor, we didn’t leave our world to  go  to  some ① remote  motorspace!  On  the  contrary,  we brought the motors into our lives, as automobiles, refrigerators, drill  presses,  and  pencil  sharpeners.  This ② absorption  has been so complete that we refer to all these tools with names that declare  their  usage,  not  their  “motorness.”  These  innovations led to a major socioeconomic movement precisely because they entered and ③ affected profoundly our everyday lives. People have  not  changed  fundamentally  in  thousands  of  years. Technology changes constantly. It’s the one that must ④ adapt to us. That’s exactly what will happen with information technology and its devices under human-centric computing. The longer we continue to believe that computers will take us to a magical new world, the longer we will ⑤ maintain their natural fusion with our lives, the hallmark of every major movement that aspires to be called a socioeconomic revolution.* hype: 과대광고 ** hallmark: 특징32. People have always wanted to be around other people and to  learn from  them.  Cities  have long  been dynamos of social possibility, foundries of art, music, and fashion. Slang, or, if you prefer,  “lexical  innovation,”  has  always  started  in  cities ― an outgrowth of all those different people so frequently exposed to one another. It spreads outward, in a manner not unlike trans-missible disease, which itself typically “takes off” in cities. If, as the noted linguist Leonard Bloomfield argued, the way a person talks is a “composite result of what he has heard before,” then language innovation would happen where the most people heard and talked to the most other people. Cities drive taste change , because they who not surprisingly are often the creative people cities seem to  attract.  Media,  ever  more  global,  ever  more  far-reaching, spread language faster to more people.* foundry: 주물 공장 ** lexical: 어휘의① reduce the social mobility of ambitious outsiders② present ideal research environments to linguists③ cause cultural conflicts among users of slang④ offer the greatest exposure to other people⑤ provide rich source materials for artists58이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\x0c633. The  entrance  to  a  honeybee  colony,  often  referred  to  as the  dancefloor,  is  a  market  place  for  information  about  the state  of  the  colony  and  the  environment  outside  the  hive. Studying  interactions  on  the  dancefloor  provides  us  with  a number  of individuals illustrative  examples  of  how changing their own behavior in response to local information . Forexample,  upon  returning  to  their  hive  honeybees  that  have collected water search out a receiver bee to unload their water to within the hive. If this search time is short then the returning bee is more likely to perform a waggle dance to recruit others to the water source. Conversely, if this search time is long then the  bee  is  more  likely  to  give  up  collecting  water.  Since receiver bees will only accept water if they require it, either for themselves or to pass on to other bees and brood, this unloading time is correlated with the colony’s overall need of water. Thus the individual water forager’s response to unloading time (up or down)  regulates  water  collection  in  response  to  the  colony’s need.

We  understand  that  the  segregation  of  our  consciousness into  present,  past,  and  future  is  both  a  fiction  and  an  oddly self-referential  framework;  your  present  was  part  of  your mother’s  future, and your children’s  past will be in  part your present.  Nothing  is  generally  wrong  with  structuring  our consciousness of time in this conventional manner, and it often works  well  enough.  In  the  case  of  climate  change,  however, the  sharp  division  of  time  into  past,  present,  and  future  has been  desperately  misleading  and  has,  most  importantly, hidden  from  view  the  extent  of  the  responsibility  of  those  of us  alive  now.  The  narrowing  of  our  consciousness  of  time smooths  the  way  to  divorcing  ourselves  from  responsibility for developments in the past and the future with which our lives are in fact deeply intertwined. In the climate case, it is not that .  It  is that the realities are obscured from view by the partitioning of time,  and  so  questions  of  responsibility  toward  the  past  and future do not arise naturally.

Learning to  control  your  voice  and  use  it  for  different  purposes  is, therefore, one of the most important skills to develop as an early career teacher. ① The more confidently you give instructions, the higher the chance of a positive class response. ② There are times when being able to project your voice loudly will be very useful when working in school, and knowing that you can cut through a noisy classroom, dinner hall or playground is a great skill  to  have. ③ In  order  to  address  serious  noise  issues  in school,  students,  parents  and  teachers  should  search  for  a solution together. ④ However, I would always advise that you use your loudest voice incredibly sparingly and avoid shouting as  much  as  possible. ⑤ A  quiet,  authoritative  and  measured tone has so much more impact than slightly panicked shouting.[36～37] 주어진  글  다음에  이어질  글의  순서로  가장  적절한 것을 고르시오.36.A  fascinating  species  of  water  flea  exhibits  a  kind  of flexibility that evolutionary biologists call adaptive plasticity.(A) That’s  a  clever  trick,  because  producing  spines  and  a helmet  is  costly,  in  terms  of  energy,  and  conserving energy is essential for an organism’s ability to survive and reproduce. The water flea only expends the energy needed to produce spines and a helmet when it needs to.(B) If the baby water flea is developing into an adult in water that  includes  the  chemical  signatures  of  creatures  that prey  on  water  fleas,  it  develops  a  helmet  and  spines  to defend  itself  against  predators.  If  the  water  around  it doesn’t  include  the  chemical  signatures  of  predators,  the water flea doesn’t develop these protective devices.(C) So  it  may  well  be  that  this  plasticity  is  an  adaptation:  a trait that came to exist in a species because it contributed to  reproductive  fitness.  There  are  many  cases,  across many species, of adaptive plasticity. Plasticity is conducive to fitness if there is sufficient variation in the environment.* spine: 가시 돌기 ** conducive: 도움되는② (B) － (A) － (C)④ (C) － (A) － (B)① (A) － (C) － (B)③ (B) － (C) － (A)⑤ (C) － (B) － (A)68이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\x0c짝수형37.39.  7The most commonly known form of results-based pricing is a practice called contingency pricing, used by lawyers.It  may  be  easier  to  reach  an  agreement  when  settlement terms don’t have to be implemented until months in the future.(A) Therefore,  only  an  outcome  in  the  client’s  favor  is compensated. From the client’s point of view, the pricing makes sense in part because most clients in these cases are unfamiliar  with  and  possibly  intimidated  by  law  firms. Their biggest fears are high fees for a case that may take years to settle.(B) By using contingency pricing, clients are ensured that they pay  no  fees  until  they  receive  a  settlement.  In  these  and other instances of contingency pricing, the economic value of the service is hard to determine before the service, and providers  develop  a  price  that  allows  them  to  share  the risks and rewards of delivering value to the buyer.(C) Contingency pricing is the major way that personal injury and  certain  consumer  cases  are  billed.  In  this  approach, lawyers  do  not  receive  fees  or  payment  until  the  case  is settled, when they are paid a percentage of the money that the client receives. [3점]Negotiators should try to find ways to slice a large issue into smaller  pieces,  known  as  using  salami  tactics. ( ① ) Issues that can be expressed in quantitative, measurable units are easy to  slice.

( ③ ) When  working  to fractionate issues of principle or precedent, parties may use the time horizon (when the principle goes into effect or how long it will  last)  as  a  way  to  fractionate  the  issue. ( ④ ) Another approach is to vary the number of ways that the principle may be  applied.

There’s  a  reason  for  that:  traditionally,  park  designers attempted to create such a feeling by planting tall trees at park  boundaries,  building  stone  walls,  and  constructing other means of partition. Parks take the shape demanded by the cultural concerns of their time. Once parks are in place, they are no inert stage ―their purposes and meanings are made and remade by planners and  by  park users. Moments  of  park  creation  are  particularly telling,  however,  for  they  reveal  and  actualize  ideas  about nature and its relationship to urban society. ( ① ) Indeed, what distinguishes a park from the broader category of public space is the representation of nature that parks are meant to embody.( ② ) Public spaces include parks, concrete plazas, sidewalks, even indoor atriums. ( ③ ) Parks typically have trees, grass, and other plants as their central features. ( ④ ) When entering a  city  park,  people  often  imagine  a  sharp  separation  from streets, cars, and buildings. ( ⑤ ) What’s behind  this idea is not  only  landscape  architects’  desire  to  design  aesthetically suggestive park spaces, but a much longer history of Western thought  that  envisions  cities  and  nature  as  antithetical  spaces and oppositional forces.* aesthetically: 미적으로 ** antithetical: 대조적인78“Craftsmanship” may suggest a way of life that declined with the arrival of industrial society ― but this is misleading. Craftsmanship  names  an  enduring,  basic  human  impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake. Craftsmanship cuts a far wider swath than skilled manual labor; it serves the  computer  programmer,  the  doctor,  and  the  artist; parenting  improves when it is practiced  as  a skilled  craft, as  does  citizenship.  In  all  these  domains,  craftsmanship focuses on objective standards, on the thing in itself. Social and economic conditions, however, often stand in the way of the craftsman’s discipline and commitment: schools may fail to provide the tools to do good work, and workplaces may not truly value the aspiration for quality. And though craftsmanship  can  reward  an  individual  with  a  sense  of pride  in  work,  this  reward  is  not  simple.  The  craftsman often  faces  conflicting  objective  standards  of  excellence; the  desire  to  do  something  well  for  its  own  sake  can  be weakened  by  competitive  pressure,  by  frustration,  or  by obsession.* swath: 구획\\U000f003bCraftsmanship, a human desire that hasover time  in  diverse  contexts,  often  encounters  factors  that (A)its full development.(B)(A)(B)① persisted … cultivate③ evolved … accelerate⑤ diminished … restrict(A)(B)② persisted … limit④ diminished … shape이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\x0c8짝수형[41～42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.(B)There  is  evidence  that  even  very  simple  algorithms  can outperform expert judgement on simple prediction problems. For example, algorithms have proved more (a) accurate than humans  in  predicting  whether  a  prisoner  released  on  parole will go on to commit another crime, or in predicting whether a potential candidate will perform well in a job in future. In over  100  studies  across  many  different  domains,  half  of  all cases  show  simple  formulas  make (b) better  significant predictions than human experts, and the remainder (except a very small handful), show a tie between the two. When there are a lot of different factors involved and a situation is very uncertain,  simple  formulas  can  win  out  by  focusing  on  the most  important  factors  and  being  consistent,  while  human judgement is too easily influenced by particularly salient and perhaps (c) irrelevant  considerations.  A  similar is supported  by  further  evidence  that  ‘checklists’  can  improve the  quality  of  expert  decisions  in  a  range  of  domains  by ensuring that important steps or considerations aren’t missed when  people  are  feeling (d) relaxed.  For  example,  treating patients  in  intensive  care  can  require  hundreds  of  small actions per day, and one small error could cost a life. Using checklists  to  ensure  that  no  crucial  steps  are  missed  has proved  to  be  remarkably (e) effective  in  a  range  of  medical contexts,  from  preventing to  reducing pneumonia.infections idea live * parole: 가석방 ** salient: 두드러진 *** pneumonia: 폐렴41. 윗글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?① The Power of Simple Formulas in Decision Making② Always Prioritise: Tips for Managing Big Data③ Algorithms’ Mistakes: The Myth of Simplicity④ Be Prepared!

[3점]\\n\\n하는 바로 가장 적절한 것은? [3점]\\n\\nComing of age in the 18th and 19th centuries, the personal \\ndiary  became  a  centerpiece  in  the  construction  of  a  modern \\nsubjectivity, at the heart of which is the application of reason \\nand  critique  to  the  understanding  of  world  and  self,  which \\nallowed the creation of a new kind of knowledge. Diaries were \\ncentral  media  through  which  enlightened  and  free  subjects \\ncould be constructed. They provided a space where one could \\nwrite  daily  about  her  whereabouts,  feelings,  and  thoughts. \\nOver  time  and  with  rereading,  disparate  entries,  events,  and \\nhappenstances  could  be  rendered  into  insights  and  narratives \\nabout the self, and allowed for the formation of subjectivity. It \\nis in that context that the idea of “the self [as] both made and \\nexplored  with  words”  emerges.  Diaries  were  personal  and \\nprivate;  one  would  write  for  oneself,  or,  in  Habermas’s \\nformulation,  one  would  make  oneself  public  to  oneself.  By \\nmaking the self public in a private sphere, the self also became \\nan object for self-inspection and self-critique.\\n\\n* disparate: 이질적인 ** render: 만들다\\n\\n① use writing as a means of reflecting on oneself\\n② build one’s identity by reading others’ diaries\\n③ exchange feedback in the process of writing\\n④ create an alternate ego to present to others\\n⑤ develop topics for writing about selfhood\\n\\nAn  important  advantage  of  disclosure,  as  opposed  to  more \\naggressive forms of regulation, is its flexibility and respect for \\nthe  operation  of  free  markets.  Regulatory  mandates  are  blunt \\nswords;  they  tend  to  neglect  diversity  and  may  have  serious \\nunintended  adverse  effects.  For  example,  energy  efficiency \\nrequirements for appliances may produce goods that work less \\nwell  or  that  have  characteristics  that  consumers  do  not  want. \\nInformation  provision,  by  contrast,  respects  freedom  of \\nchoice.  If  automobile  manufacturers  are  required  to  measure \\nand  publicize  the  safety  characteristics  of  cars,  potential  car \\npurchasers  can  trade  safety  concerns  against  other  attributes, \\nsuch as price and styling. If restaurant customers are informed \\nof  the  calories  in  their  meals,  those  who  want  to  lose  weight \\ncan  make  use  of  the  information,  leaving  those  who  are \\nunconcerned  about  calories  unaffected.  Disclosure  does  not \\ninterfere  with,  and  should  even  promote,  the  autonomy  (and \\nquality) of individual decision-making.\\n\\n* mandate: 명령 ** adverse: 거스르는 *** autonomy: 자율성\\n\\n① steps to make public information accessible to customers \\n② benefits of publicizing information to ensure free choices\\n③ strategies for companies to increase profits in a free market\\n④ necessities of identifying and analyzing current industry trends\\n⑤ effects of diversified markets on reasonable customer choices\\n\\n22. 다음 글의 요지로 가장 적절한 것은?\\n\\n24. 다음 글의 제목으로 가장 적절한 것은?\\n\\nUrban  delivery  vehicles  can  be  adapted  to  better  suit  the \\ndensity  of  urban  distribution,  which  often  involves  smaller \\nvehicles such as vans, including bicycles. The latter have the \\npotential to become a preferred ‘last-mile’ vehicle, particularly \\nin  high-density  and  congested  areas.  In  locations  where \\nbicycle use is high, such as the Netherlands, delivery bicycles \\nare also  used  to carry  personal cargo  (e.g.  groceries).  Due  to \\ntheir  low  acquisition  and  maintenance  costs,  cargo  bicycles \\nconvey much potential in developed and developing countries \\nalike, such as the becak (a three-wheeled bicycle) in Indonesia. \\nServices  using  electrically  assisted  delivery  tricycles  have \\nbeen  successfully  implemented  in  France  and  are  gradually \\nbeing  adopted  across  Europe  for  services  as  varied  as  parcel \\nand  catering  deliveries.  Using  bicycles  as  cargo  vehicles  is \\nparticularly  encouraged  when  combined  with  policies  that \\nrestrict motor vehicle access to specific areas of a city, such as \\ndowntown  or  commercial  districts,  or  with  the  extension  of \\ndedicated bike lanes.\\n\\nDifferent parts of the brain’s visual system get information \\non  a  need-to-know  basis.  Cells  that  help  your  hand  muscles \\nreach  out  to  an  object  need  to  know  the  size  and  location  of \\nthe object, but they don’t need to know about color. They need \\nto know a little about shape, but not in great detail. Cells that \\nhelp  you  recognize  people’s  faces  need  to  be  extremely \\nsensitive to details of shape, but they can pay less attention to \\nlocation. It is natural to assume that anyone who sees an object \\nsees  everything  about  it ― the  shape,  color,  location,  and \\nmovement.  However,  one  part  of  your  brain  sees  its  shape, \\nanother  sees  color,  another  detects  location,  and  another \\nperceives  movement.  Consequently,  after  localized  brain \\ndamage,  it  is  possible  to  see  certain  aspects  of  an  object  and \\nnot others. Centuries ago, people found it difficult to imagine \\nhow someone could see an object without seeing what color it \\nis.  Even  today,  you  might  find  it  surprising  to  learn  about \\npeople who see an object without seeing where it is, or see it \\nwithout seeing whether it is moving.\\n\\n① 도시에서 자전거는 효율적인 배송 수단으로 사용될 수 있다.\\n② 자전거는 출퇴근 시간을 줄이기 위한 대안으로 선호되고 있다.\\n\\n③ 자전거는 배송 수단으로의 경제적 장단점을 모두 가질 수 있다.\\n\\n④ 수요자의 요구에 부합하는 다양한 용도의 자전거가 개발되고 있다.\\n⑤ 세계 각국에서는 전기 자전거 사용을 장려하는 정책을 추진하고 있다.\\n\\n① Visual Systems Never Betray Our Trust!\\n② Secret Missions of Color-Sensitive Brain Cells\\n③ Blind Spots: What Is Still Unknown About the Brain\\n④ Why Brain Cells Exemplify Nature’s Recovery Process\\n⑤ Separate and Independent: Brain Cells’ Visual Perceptions\\n\\n3\\n\\n8\\n\\n이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\x0c4\\n\\n홀수형\\n\\n25. 다음 도표의 내용과 일치하지 않는  것은?\\n\\n27. 다음 Renovation Notice의 내용과 일치하지 않는  것은?\\n\\nRenovation Notice\\n\\nAt the Natural Jade Resort, we are continually improving \\nour facilities to better serve our guests.

To \\nunderstand  how  trends  can  ultimately  give  individuals  power \\nand freedom, one must first discuss fashion’s importance as a \\nbasis  for  change.  The  most  common  explanation  offered  by \\nmy  informants  as to why fashion  is so  appealing  is ① that it \\nconstitutes a kind of theatrical costumery. Clothes are part of \\nhow people present ② them to the world, and fashion locates \\nthem  in  the  present,  relative  to  what  is  happening  in  society \\nand to fashion’s own history. As a form of expression, fashion \\ncontains a host of ambiguities, enabling individuals to recreate \\nthe  meanings ③ associated  with  specific  pieces  of  clothing. \\nFashion  is  among  the  simplest  and  cheapest  methods  of \\nself-expression:  clothes  can  be ④ inexpensively  purchased \\nwhile making it easy to convey notions of wealth, intellectual \\nstature,  relaxation  or  environmental  consciousness,  even  if \\nnone  of  these  is  true.  Fashion  can  also  strengthen  agency  in \\nvarious ways, ⑤ opening up space for action.\\n\\n* stature: 능력\\n\\n31. There is something deeply paradoxical about the professional \\nstatus of sports journalism, especially in the medium of print. \\nIn  discharging  their  usual  responsibilities  of  description  and \\ncommentary,  reporters’  accounts  of  sports  events  are  eagerly \\nconsulted  by  sports  fans,  while  in  their  broader  journalistic \\nrole of covering sport in its many forms, sports journalists are \\namong  the  most  visible  of  all  contemporary  writers.  The \\nruminations  of  the  elite  class  of  ‘celebrity’  sports  journalists \\nare much sought after by the major newspapers, their lucrative \\ncontracts being the envy of colleagues in other ‘disciplines’ of \\njournalism.  Yet  sports  journalists  do  not  have  a  standing  in \\ntheir profession that corresponds to the size of their readerships \\nor of their pay packets, with the old saying (now reaching the \\nstatus of cliché) that sport is the ‘toy department of the news \\nmedia’ still readily to hand as a dismissal of the worth of what \\nsports journalists do.

When the Industrial Revolution arrived \\nwith its great innovation, the motor, we didn’t leave our world \\nto  go  to  some ① remote  motorspace!  On  the  contrary,  we \\nbrought the motors into our lives, as automobiles, refrigerators, \\ndrill  presses,  and  pencil  sharpeners.  This ② absorption  has \\nbeen so complete that we refer to all these tools with names that \\ndeclare  their  usage,  not  their  “motorness.”  These  innovations \\nled to a major socioeconomic movement precisely because they \\nentered and ③ affected profoundly our everyday lives. People \\nhave  not  changed  fundamentally  in  thousands  of  years. \\nTechnology changes constantly. It’s the one that must ④ adapt \\nto us. That’s exactly what will happen with information technology \\nand its devices under human-centric computing.

People have always wanted to be around other people and \\nto  learn from  them.  Cities  have long  been dynamos of social \\npossibility, foundries of art, music, and fashion.

It spreads outward, in a manner not unlike trans-\\nmissible disease, which itself typically “takes off” in cities. If, as \\nthe noted linguist Leonard Bloomfield argued, the way a person \\ntalks is a “composite result of what he has heard before,” then \\nlanguage innovation would happen where the most people heard \\nand talked to the most other people.

The  entrance  to  a  honeybee  colony,  often  referred  to  as \\nthe  dancefloor,  is  a  market  place  for  information  about  the \\nstate  of  the  colony  and  the  environment  outside  the  hive. \\nStudying  interactions  on  the  dancefloor  provides  us  with  a \\nnumber  of \\nindividuals \\nillustrative  examples  of  how \\nchanging their own behavior in response to local information \\n. For\\nexample,  upon  returning  to  their  hive  honeybees  that  have \\ncollected water search out a receiver bee to unload their water \\nto within the hive. If this search time is short then the returning \\nbee is more likely to perform a waggle dance to recruit others \\nto the water source. Conversely, if this search time is long then \\nthe  bee  is  more  likely  to  give  up  collecting  water.  Since \\nreceiver bees will only accept water if they require it, either for \\nthemselves or to pass on to other bees and brood, this unloading \\ntime is correlated with the colony’s overall need of water.

From the client’s point of view, the pricing \\nmakes sense in part because most clients in these cases are \\nunfamiliar  with  and  possibly  intimidated  by  law  firms. \\nTheir biggest fears are high fees for a case that may take \\nyears to settle.\\n\\n(B) By using contingency pricing, clients are ensured that they \\npay  no  fees  until  they  receive  a  settlement.  In  these  and \\nother instances of contingency pricing, the economic value \\nof the service is hard to determine before the service, and \\nproviders  develop  a  price  that  allows  them  to  share  the \\nrisks and rewards of delivering value to the buyer.\\n\\n(C) Contingency pricing is the major way that personal injury \\nand  certain  consumer  cases  are  billed.

They provided a space where one could \\nwrite  daily  about  her  whereabouts,  feelings,  and  thoughts. \\nOver  time  and  with  rereading,  disparate  entries,  events,  and \\nhappenstances  could  be  rendered  into  insights  and  narratives \\nabout the self, and allowed for the formation of subjectivity. It \\nis in that context that the idea of “the self [as] both made and \\nexplored  with  words”  emerges.  Diaries  were  personal  and \\nprivate;  one  would  write  for  oneself,  or,  in  Habermas’s \\nformulation,  one  would  make  oneself  public  to  oneself.  By \\nmaking the self public in a private sphere, the self also became \\nan object for self-inspection and self-critique.\\n\\n* disparate: 이질적인 ** render: 만들다\\n\\n① use writing as a means of reflecting on oneself\\n② build one’s identity by reading others’ diaries\\n③ exchange feedback in the process of writing\\n④ create an alternate ego to present to others\\n⑤ develop topics for writing about selfhood\\n\\nAn  important  advantage  of  disclosure,  as  opposed  to  more \\naggressive forms of regulation, is its flexibility and respect for \\nthe  operation  of  free  markets.

For  example,  energy  efficiency \\nrequirements for appliances may produce goods that work less \\nwell  or  that  have  characteristics  that  consumers  do  not  want. \\nInformation  provision,  by  contrast,  respects  freedom  of \\nchoice.

In  locations  where \\nbicycle use is high, such as the Netherlands, delivery bicycles \\nare also  used  to carry  personal cargo  (e.g.  groceries).  Due  to \\ntheir  low  acquisition  and  maintenance  costs,  cargo  bicycles \\nconvey much potential in developed and developing countries \\nalike, such as the becak (a three-wheeled bicycle) in Indonesia. \\nServices  using  electrically  assisted  delivery  tricycles  have \\nbeen  successfully  implemented  in  France  and  are  gradually \\nbeing  adopted  across  Europe  for  services  as  varied  as  parcel \\nand  catering  deliveries.

To \\nunderstand  how  trends  can  ultimately  give  individuals  power \\nand freedom, one must first discuss fashion’s importance as a \\nbasis  for  change.  The  most  common  explanation  offered  by \\nmy  informants  as to why fashion  is so  appealing  is ① that it \\nconstitutes a kind of theatrical costumery. Clothes are part of \\nhow people present ② them to the world, and fashion locates \\nthem  in  the  present,  relative  to  what  is  happening  in  society \\nand to fashion’s own history. As a form of expression, fashion \\ncontains a host of ambiguities, enabling individuals to recreate \\nthe  meanings ③ associated  with  specific  pieces  of  clothing. \\nFashion  is  among  the  simplest  and  cheapest  methods  of \\nself-expression:  clothes  can  be ④ inexpensively  purchased \\nwhile making it easy to convey notions of wealth, intellectual \\nstature,  relaxation  or  environmental  consciousness,  even  if \\nnone  of  these  is  true.  Fashion  can  also  strengthen  agency  in \\nvarious ways, ⑤ opening up space for action.\\n\\n31.

The \\nruminations  of  the  elite  class  of  ‘celebrity’  sports  journalists \\nare much sought after by the major newspapers, their lucrative \\ncontracts being the envy of colleagues in other ‘disciplines’ of \\njournalism.

Conversely, if this search time is long then \\nthe  bee  is  more  likely  to  give  up  collecting  water.  Since \\nreceiver bees will only accept water if they require it, either for \\nthemselves or to pass on to other bees and brood, this unloading \\ntime is correlated with the colony’s overall need of water.

The  craftsman \\noften  faces  conflicting  objective  standards  of  excellence; \\nthe  desire  to  do  something  well  for  its  own  sake  can  be \\nweakened  by  competitive  pressure,  by  frustration,  or  by \\nobsession.\\n\\n* swath: 구획\\n\\n\\U000f003b\\n\\nCraftsmanship, a human desire that has\\nover \\ntime  in  diverse  contexts,  often  encounters  factors  that \\n\\n(A)\\n\\nits full development.\\n\\n(B)\\n\\n(A)\\n\\n(B)\\n\\n① persisted … cultivate\\n③ evolved … accelerate\\n⑤ diminished … restrict\\n\\n(A)\\n\\n(B)\\n② persisted … limit\\n④ diminished … shape\\n\\n이 문제지에 관한 저작권은 한국교육과정평가원에 있습니다.\\x0c8\\n\\n짝수형\\n\\n[41～42] 다음 글을 읽고, 물음에 답하시오.\\n\\n(B)\\n\\nThere  is  evidence  that  even  very  simple  algorithms  can \\noutperform expert judgement on simple prediction problems. \\nFor example, algorithms have proved more (a) accurate than \\nhumans  in  predicting  whether  a  prisoner  released  on  parole \\nwill go on to commit another crime, or in predicting whether \\na potential candidate will perform well in a job in future.

When there \\nare a lot of different factors involved and a situation is very \\nuncertain,  simple  formulas  can  win  out  by  focusing  on  the \\nmost  important  factors  and  being  consistent,  while  human \\njudgement is too easily influenced by particularly salient and \\nperhaps (c) irrelevant  considerations.

For  example,  treating \\npatients  in  intensive  care  can  require  hundreds  of  small \\nactions per day, and one small error could cost a life.
